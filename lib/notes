CLI PROJECT -- STAR WARS CHARACTER DIRECTORY

What I want it to do: 
-Greet a user and present a selection of Star Wars character names
    -"Welcome! Which character would you like to know about?" Show selection
-Have an option to exit program, put out a phrase if this is the case
-If they do not exit program and select a character, display character name, age, and birth year. 
-Provide option at this point to select another character: bring back to main menu
-Provide option to exit at this point: put out goodbye phrase
