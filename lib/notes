CLI PROJECT -- STAR WARS CHARACTER DIRECTORY

What I want it to do: 
-Greet a user and present a selection of Star Wars character names
    -"Welcome! Which character would you like to know about?" Show selection
-Have an option to exit program 
-If they do not exit program and select a character, display character name, age, and rank. Do they belong to 
the Republic or the Empire
